## 2026-10-20 — PHASE 0 summary (new lead executor)

1. Product: Courier Copilot, voice-first SaaS for independent NZ parcel couriers on fixed runs in Canterbury/Christchurch.
2. Binding spec: docs/FINAL_PROMPT.md (§0, 0-A..0-F bind); DECISIONS.md D1–D21 override everything.
3. Stack (candidates, pinned only via ADR-001): Expo SDK 57 (locked), React Native, Unistyles 3, MapLibre v11 + PMTiles, VisionCamera, sherpa-onnx, op-sqlite (SQLCipher+FTS5), Reanimated 4, FastAPI backend, Better Auth (Node, JWKS to FastAPI), Pipecat + LiveKit voice, Hatchet jobs, Valhalla+VROOM routing, Postgres+PostGIS, Next.js web.

5. Real state (from RESUME.md, unverified until PHASE 1): auth is a fake Python implementation; theme.ts uses var(--); C.2 correction engine (D8) missing; B.7 compat test NOT VERIFIED; most steps not started.
6. Repo: branch main, HEAD 9fbece5. Untracked services/auth/ exists (from previous executor) — to be audited.
7. Rules: evidence in docs/evidence/<step>/; no PASS without logs; no force-push/rebase; git pull before push; no destructive commands.
8. Local data: LINZ data expected in data/linz/ (gitignored); not present at audit start.
9. Android SDK/emulator status: to be checked in PHASE 1/3.
10. First 5 tasks: (a) PHASE 1 audit + logs; (b) rewrite PROGRESS.md; (c) fix Better Auth (2.1); (d) theme var() removal (2.2); (e) address engine D8 (2.3).

Not yet read in PHASE 0: PRODUCT_SPEC, PROJECT_BRIEF, DRIVER_INTERVIEW_1, research docs, PLAN_REVIEW (to be skimmed during PHASE 1).
